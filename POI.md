# Fraud detection: A machine learning approach to detecting persons of interest

## Synopsis
This project investigates the Enron scandal of the early 2000s in an attempt
to build a classifier which detects employees involved in the scandal.
Both financial and email data were combined into a dataset.

## Project content
* Exploratory data analysis
  * Outlier detection
  * Removal of erroneous data value

* Feature engineering
  * Dealing with missing values
  * Feature selection

* Dealing with imbalanced data
  * Using Synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE)

* Model selection
  * Comparison of different classifiers
  * Hyperparameter tuning using a Randomized Grid Search

* Prediction
  * Using performance metrics to analyze reliability of results e.g. Recall,
    precision, F1-score
  * Visualizing results using a confusion matrix
